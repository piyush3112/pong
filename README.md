Classic Pong Game 
We're actually playing against a basic computer
Score is updated there on the left side, whenever I score a point or whenever the computer scores a point and then the ball resets in the center.
The winning score by default will be seven points, and then we will see a GAMEOVER screen which tells
us who won in this case, the computer one, and then it has a play again button that allows us to seamlessly restart another game.
